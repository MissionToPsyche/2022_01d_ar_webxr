# 2022_01d_ar_webxr

#### `ar-example.html` code is adapted from the Three.js repo example here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/examples/webxr_ar_cones.html

#### To run the AR example on your phone (Chrome Browser only):

1. Install VS Code if you don't have it already
2. Install the "Live Server" extension
3. Since WebXR requires HTTPS, you can follow the instructions here to create a self-signed certificate and run Live Server in HTTPS mode: https://gist.github.com/prof3ssorSt3v3/edb2632a362b3731274cfab84e9973f9 
4. Right click on the `ar-example.html` file in VS code and select "Open with Live Server"
5. Navigate to your computer's IP address on your phone, eg. `https://192.168.0.2:5501/ar-example.html` ensuring that you're connected to the same network as your computer. 
6. Tap the "START AR" button
7. Tap on the screen to make rotating objects appear in AR
